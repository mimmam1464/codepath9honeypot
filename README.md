Summary of data collected: After 35 minutes of running nmap on the IP address, The sensors reported 3340 attacks and is still rising in numbers.The attacks are coming from different countries inclding US, China, Singapore with most attacks basing from China.

Unresolved Question: Why is the attack numbers rising constantly? What does this signify? Is some program constantly hitting the servers when we initiate nmap?
